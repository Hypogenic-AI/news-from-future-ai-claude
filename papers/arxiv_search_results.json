The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling, focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5...",

Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks?

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downst...",

In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land in h...",

While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies the denoising trajectory using classifier gra...",

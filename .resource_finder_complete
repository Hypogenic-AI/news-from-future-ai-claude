Repositories cloned: 3

Summary:
- Conducted comprehensive literature search on LLMs, prediction markets, and news generation
- Downloaded 37 relevant papers from arXiv covering forecasting, fake news, and controllable generation
- Downloaded XSum (226K news articles) and Fake News English datasets
- Cloned ForecastBench, LLM Forecasting, and LLM Misinformation repositories
- Created comprehensive literature_review.md synthesizing key findings
- Created resources.md cataloging all gathered resources

Key papers for the research:
1. ForecastBench (ICLR 2025) - LLM forecasting benchmark
2. FakeGPT - LLM fake news generation methodology  
3. OpenEP - Open-ended future event prediction
4. AI-Augmented Predictions - Human-LLM forecasting collaboration

Research gaps identified:
- No existing work directly combines prediction markets with news generation
- Novel opportunity to create probability-conditioned future news generation

Next steps for experiment runner:
- Use ForecastBench methodology for probability sourcing
- Apply FakeGPT prompting techniques for realistic news generation
- Evaluate with combination of automated metrics and human judgment
